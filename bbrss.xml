            <title>Assignment 2: option to reset your database table (Web Technology 2015)</title>

            <description>Dear all,
                Most of you have by now a large number of test values in your table, both from testing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.
                Several of you requested a service to reset your table to the original values. This has been implemented (thanks Jelmer!) and is now deployed after I updated the server this morning.
                I just have performed a reset on my own key�d1f21b14�using:
                http://wt.ops.few.vu.nl/api/d1f21b14/reset
                You can do the same if you would like to start from fresh with your original table values, by replacing the key with your own key. Of course this is entirely optional, the actual values in your table will in no way influence the grading.
                Success with finishing Assignment 2</description>

                    <description>Dear all,
                        During this morning's lab A group session, some students had trouble getting started with assignment 2.�Here are a few tips for all of you (mostly repeating tips given during the lectures):

                        Start the lab session with Assignment 2, as it continues the client-side work you did in lab 2 last week, and do the server-side lab questions only if you have made a good start with Assignment 2.
                        Have a look at the recipes�shown in the lecture, see slides 29-32 of lecture 4 (course link attached)
                        Make sure you have seen the ajax in jquery example referred to in slide 29! (http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ajax_ajax.asp)
                        Make sure you have a working example from the jquery tutorial and start making changes from there, line by line
                        Now where your browser's console is and how to use it to log useful information

                        Good luck!</description>

                                <description>Some of you asked about what to do if you failed the socket assignments. In principle, the idea was that you would be out of luck. However, to prevent you from having to wait for another year, what I will do for the next (resit) exam is add a question on sockets programming -- only for those who failed the assignments. The question will be fail/pass and not count for your overall grade (except that you *have* get a pass).
                                    Oh an FYI: I am still busy grading the exam.

                                <description>Dear student,
                                    Welcome to the Web Technology course!
                                    The course starts Monday, with the first two lectures. The requires some preparation from your side:

                                    Around 50 of you have not yet enrolled for a lab group. �If you have not done so already, please do as soon as possible! This allows us to decide how many lab groups we need!�
                                    Please make the first Lecture preparation questions (see attachement) before you come the first lectures.

                                    Hope to see you all on Monday,
                                    Jacco van Ossenbruggen</description>

                                    <description>Dear students,
                                        Some of you asked for course material so they could start preparing for the course during the Xmas break.
                                        I've now made a preliminary reader available so you can already get a first glimpse of what the course will be about.�I expect to add more material in the coming weeks and during the course.
                                        First two lectures start on Monday January 5Please make sure you have read the Reader's introduction and the material marked with Lecture 1 and Lecture 2 before you come the first lectures.
                                        For those of you who have not yet enrolled for a lab group, please do so! �This allows us to estimate how many lab groups we need!

                                        Thanks, and best wishes,

                                        <description>Dear all,  This is our last week. During your last lab session you will proudly present your projects. The first 20 min you will all have time to build your robot or/and setup and prepare it for a demo. Thereafter, each group will have ca 10 min to present and demonstrate.  The structure of your Powerpoint presentation should be similar to your final document.� You have to say what did you design, why is this a pervasive system, who will use it and how, describe the system (hardware and software), which safety and ethical issues did you investigate, how did it work in practice, what did you learn, etc.�  The demo has to be simple, but working. It is good to make in advance a videoclip with your demo and send it to your TA so that we can build a folder in BB with all these nice results. This will be interesting for your colleagues but also for new students next year. Please mail also in advance your presentation to your TA.  There is a folder in BB called Project, where you can find examples of project documents. Other info about the project deliverables can be found in the Course Guide.  Good luck !  �Natalia Silvis

                                            <description>1. In order to use your lab time efficiently, we recommend you to write down a plan for each session. You should know exactly what are you going to do at the beginning of each session. For example: Today we will test the camera in front of a traffic light, or we will recognize two simple notes A and C, etc. Bring this plan to lab class, and discuss it shortly together with your TA.
                                                You can include these plans in your final report and reflect on possible discrepancies between your "nice" plans and the "harsh" reality.��
                                                2. Before searching for solutions on Internet, take a look at the Classification recipes in BB where you can find ideas and almost ready-to-use solutions.

                                                <description>It seems the deadline for the first test is not visible �for you(?!). Anyway, you should submit the test before the lecture on next week Monday. Strictly speaking: 24/11, 15:30 (but you have a few minutes grace). Do not miss the deadline. That would be very very bad. It is better to fail it than to not make it. You have more than enough time, so play it safe and submit a day early.</description>

                                                <description>Assignment 2 of the excellence track is now available under course documents. The deadline is November 28th. Make sure to start on time, as it is significantly more difficult than the first assignment.

                                                    We are currently grading the first assignment, and expect to have the grades this week. Each of you will receive a personal document with some feedback. In general the assignment was well made, except for the second bonus question. Many of you did recover the image payload, but none of you found the text message which was steganographically hidden within the image. We will therefore be lenient in grading this question.</description>

                                                                The grades will not be improved, but it is a good opportunity to practice, as Lab1 builds the basics for Lab3 and Lab4.
                                                                The sessions are planned on Monday 10 nov:
                                                                11:00-12:45 in S353
                                                                15:30-17:00 in S329
                                                                If you intend to attend, you have to register by sending an email to Natalia Silvis.

Diffferent period, different book, different assignment (but similarly tough exam)!We will use BB as our main means of communication, and I will try to push all slides to the Course Documents&amp;gt; section as soon as I have them. Also make sure to check out David's video lectures:�
                                                                            � http://media.pearsoncmg.com/ph/streaming/esm/tanenbaum5e_videonotes/tanenbaum_videoNotes.html

                                                                            Also make sure to use the discussion forum for all your questions related to the course material, assignments, and excellence track. Finally, during the course, I will make several online tests available via BB. More about this during the lectures.
                                                                            Good luck on computer networks this year -- and happy hacking!

                                                                                            Tomorrow the IMM-students have the feedback lecture of MOTI planned at 11:00. Because some students will want to attend, and Romy will arrive at 11:00, group 2 students risk going without help during the practicum. That is why tomorrow, all IMM students of group 2 and 4 will have their practicum in P447, and all LI students of 2 and 4 in P337. You will receive the feedback of last week's assignment in your grade center.

                                                                                                <description>Dear students,
                                                                                                    It seems that a lot of students have problems with question 6 of assignment 3. So here is some explanation what is expected from you.
                                                                                                    In 6a we ask you for all the steps that you need to look up a recipe in a list with recipes. Compare this with looking up something in Google, e.g., something about an iPhone. Name all the steps that you would take to look up the information about an iPhone. This means starting with typing the search key to displaying the output (=the search results).
                                                                                                    In 6b you are asked to put the steps, you named in 6a, into a flowchart.
                                                                                                    In 6c you are asked to show us that following those steps in 6a really works. This means look up a function (please do not write program codes) in Mathematica which makes that possible. You could use, e.g., the search keys "Find", "Search" in Mathematica to find a particular function to make that work.
                                                                                                    The questions 6d and 6e are clear I think.
                                                                                                    You may hand in question 6 of this assignment till tomorrow (20 Sept.) before 1.00 PM.
                                                                                                    Good luck,
                                                                                                    Aniel Bhulai</description>

                                                                                                        There are some confusions between comparisons and rum time complexity due to a mistake in slide 19 of the search algorithms. I have just uploaded the correct version of the slide. Please, take note of it. I apologize for any inconvenience and the confusion this may have caused. In the next lecture I will come back to this.

I expect that you will all still be there at 11:00.�I want to make a general announchement about the collective mistakes made during assignment 1. After this I'll give you individual feedback on assignment 1. This is also important for some of you with regards to assignment 2, so you don't make the same mistakes.

As such, you are expected to work independently during this time.

The other TA will also check whether you are present at the practicum.

                                                                                                                            Since it wasn't clear for everybody where you can find the working group you're placed in, there are three options to determine this:
                                                                                                                            1. To determine which working group you are placed in, click on the link below or go to 'Working Groups -&amp;gt; Overview of working groups'.
                                                                                                                            2. Another possibility is that you can also view your group in the left-hand side of the menu. You will see something like 'Group CS 1', meaning that you are placed in working group 1.
                                                                                                                            3. In VUnet you can find the group you're placed in by looking at your personal schedule.
                                                                                                                            The group you you'll see on Blackboard corresponds with the groups on rooster.vu.nl . The email addresses of your working group tutor can be found under 'Contacts'. On the rooster.vu.nl website you can also see who your tutor is. We also placed this information under 'Course Information'.
                                                                                                                            Please also check that the group in which you are registerd is the same group as in Blackboard.
                                                                                                                            If you have any trouble regarding your group assignment or Blackboard, please contact me: b.p.m.rodenburg@vu.nl</description>
